# Project directives
1. In /front-end, build a simple react app (using zustand for state management) that allows a user to use three AI modes: research, summarization and fact-checking. The chat interface should be built to allow rendering of streamed responses. All modes should allow file selection.

This project is a way for me to practise building AI applications. build only the frontend interface and mock/simulate any backend simulations.
